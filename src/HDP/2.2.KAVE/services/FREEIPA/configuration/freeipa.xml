        <description>
            The password of the user created for binding services through LDAP. Must be at least 8
            characters long. This setting is not automatically picked up by the services which would
            want to bind. This only used to generate this specific user. Be sure
            to set ipa_integration_enabled to True on the service you want to
            integrate and the ipa_bind_password to the same value as provided here.

            If this setting is not set the give user is not generated during
            installation. If you at a later stage still want this option you'll
            have to go through the ipa interface to generate itself. This setting
            will not be interpreted twice.

        <description>
            Json description of intial users to add to FreeIPA, along with any groups.
            If these users and groups already exist, nothing is done.
            you can use the simple format:
            e.g.: {"Users" : ["bob","eve"], "Groups" : { "gitlab" : ["bob"], "scientists" : ["eve", "bob"], "admins" : ["bob"] } }
            of the extended format:
            e.g.: {"Users" : [{ "username" : "bob"},{"username": "eve"}], "Groups" : [ {"name":"gitlab", "members" : ["bob"]},{"name":"admins", "members" : ["bob"]}] }
            If you want to make some special admin users, you should add them here.
            By default random passwords are assigned which must be changed on first login. If you want to specify the passwords yourself
            then add a password to the initial_user_password field.

            All passwords set this way must be at least eight characters.
            If set this way, passwords must be changed on the first login of this user.

            This will install the FreeIPA server with a DNS. This will also
            overwrite some dns related network settings.
            PLEASE NOTE! The network settings are NOT permanently overwriten.
            this is the machine owners responsibility.
            PLEASE NOTE! The install without dns is not tested.
