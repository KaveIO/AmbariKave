# Example twiki.conf file to configure Apache for TWiki.
#
# You can base your Apache configuration for TWiki on this example
# file, but you are invited to use the Apache config generator at
# http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/ApacheConfigGenerator
# to easily create an Apache conf file specific to your needs.
# Copy the generated content into a twiki.conf file and put it into
# the shared conf directory, typically at /etc/httpd/conf.d or
# /etc/apache2/conf.d.

# NOTE: If you use Apache 2.4 or later make sure to enable CGI
# in the primary apache configuration file (mod_cgi or mod_cgid).

# The first parameter will be part of the URL to your installation e.g.
# http://example.com/twiki/bin/view/...
#### You can change the first parameter to a short /do -- this parameter
#    and {ScriptUrlPath} configure setting must be the same.
# The second parameter must point to the physical path on your disk.
#### Change the _second_ path to match your local installation
ScriptAlias /twiki/bin "{{install_dir}}bin"

# This defines a url that points to the twiki pub directory, which contains
# attachments and other files like CSS stylesheets and icons.
#### Change the path to match your local installation
Alias /twiki/pub "{{install_dir}}pub"

# Block access to typical spam related attachments (.htm and .html files)
# Except the TWiki directory which is read only and does have attached html files.
# You should uncomment the two lines below if the TWiki is on the public Internet
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "twiki/pub/.*\.[hH][tT][mM]?$" blockAccess
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "twiki/pub/TWiki/.*\.[hH][tT][mM]?$" !blockAccess

# We set an environment variable called blockAccess.
#
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents TWiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other TWikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
#
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a TWiki.
# http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator has a good list
# of bad spiders to block.
#
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker blockAccess
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ blockAccess

# This specifies the options on the TWiki scripts directory. The ExecCGI
# and SetHandler tell apache that it contains scripts. "Allow from all"
# lets any IP address access this URL.

#### Change the path to match your local installation
<Directory "{{install_dir}}bin">
	AllowOverride None
# NOTE: For Apache 2.4 and later use "Require all granted" instead of the next two lines:
	Order Allow,Deny
	Allow from all
	Deny from env=blockAccess

	Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
	SetHandler cgi-script
