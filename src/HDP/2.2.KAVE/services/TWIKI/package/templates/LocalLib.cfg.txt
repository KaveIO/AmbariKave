# ------------++ Path to TWiki's CPAN base.
# OPTIONAL:
# TWiki ships with some CPAN modules, such as File::Temp. They load after
# the default Perl libs. If you want to load them before the system libs,
# uncomment the following line.

# $CPANBASE = "$twikiLibPath/CPAN/lib/";

# ------------++ Extra path components to include in @INC
# OPTIONAL:
# If you need to use perl modules that are not installed in the standard
# directories (e.g. you have downloaded extra modules for use with plugins)
# then you can add the absolute paths to those modules below. You can list
# as many directories as you want, separated by commas.

# @localPerlLibPath = ( '/path/to/dir' );

# http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html?page=3 has good advice
# on installing CPAN modules without superuser privileges.
